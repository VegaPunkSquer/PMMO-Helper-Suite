üöÄ Starting Your Journey (Installation and Configuration)
To unlock the full power of The Silph Scope, follow these two quick steps:

Step 1: Install Tesseract-OCR (For the Stat Scanner)
Tesseract is the "brain" that allows the app to read in-game images.

Important Note: Installing Tesseract is mandatory ONLY for the OCR Calculator tab. If you don't plan on using the stat scanner, you can skip this step. All other app features will work perfectly without it!

Download the Installer:

Go to the official page: Tesseract at UB Mannheim

Download the latest version for Windows from the link: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki (e.g., tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-vX.X.X....exe).

Run the Installation (Carefully!):

Follow the installation instructions.

CRUCIAL STEP: On the "Additional script data" screen, CHECK THE "Add Tesseract to system PATH" box. Skipping this will be like trying to use a Thunderbolt without power. It won't work.

Finish and Restart:

Finish the installation. If the app was already open, close it and reopen it.

Step 2: Initial Scanner Calibration
Before using the scanner for the first time, you need to "teach" the app where to look.

In the app, go to the OCR Calculator tab.

Click the "Calibrate Positions" button. Your screen will become semi-transparent.

Go into the game and open any Pok√©mon's stats screen.

Follow the instructions in the center of the screen, clicking and dragging to select the area for each stat.

After calibrating the last item, the calibration is automatically saved. This step only needs to be done once!

That's it! Your The Silph Scope is now at 100% HP and ready for battle.

üîÆ Next Steps (Future Updates)
@sam and his team are always evolving PMMO, and The Silph Scope is following suit! Keep an eye out for future updates, which may include:

Move Analysis: Details on Boss attacks and suggestions for Pok√©mon with super-effective moves.

Damage Calculator: A tool to predict the damage of specific attacks.

And much more, based on community feedback and game updates!
