Patch Notes v0.1 - v2.0.1 - The Silph Scope
Here are the technical details for curious Trainers:
Hello, Trainers!

Welcome to the definitive version of The Silph Scope! My name is Vega, and this project is my passion for Pokémon and the Pokémon MMO 3D transformed into a complete tool suite.

To celebrate this launch, I've prepared a summary of the application's own "evolution," detailing the technical journey that brought us here.

v0.1 - The Foundation
NEW

Collection Manager: The app's core. A system to add, edit, and save Pokémon with essential data (level, nature, IVs, EVs, notes).

v0.3 - The Dawn of Strategy
NEW

Team Analyzer (Basic): An initial tool to assemble a team of up to 6 Pokémon and generate a detailed analysis of their defensive weaknesses and resistances.

v0.5 - Simulating Combat
NEW

Battle Planner (Beta): First implementation of a boss battle simulation, calculating basic counters based purely on type advantage.

v0.8 - The Master's Tools
NEW

EV Training Guide: An integrated database that suggests the best locations and Pokémon for training specific EVs, including location maps.

NEW

Shiny Hunt Tracker: A module with a timer and encounter counter to help organize and keep records of your hunts.

v1.0 - The Great Logic Overhaul
UPDATE

Battle Planner 2.0: The system is out of Beta. The simulation logic was rebuilt from the ground up to include a deeper analysis of base stats, damage, and survival time, resulting in a much more accurate "Battle Index".

UPDATE

Database: Added data for moves, new Pokémon, and bosses to power the new battle logic.

v1.1 - The Machine's Eye
NEW

Stats Calculator (OCR): Implementation of an Optical Character Recognition system. By pressing F10, the app captures a screen region and automatically extracts stats for quick addition to the collection.

v1.2 - Refinement & QoL
NEW

Themes & Languages: Added support for multiple themes (Dark, Light, Pokémon) and languages (pt-br, en-us), selectable in the new Settings tab.

NEW

Global Sorting: Implemented an option in Settings to define the default sort order (Alphabetical or Pokédex), which is now respected across all Pokémon lists in the app.

FIX

Various fixes to the OCR logic and overall app stability.

v1.3 - The Living Interface
QoL

Visual Table: The Collection tab's main table was redesigned to include a column with each Pokémon's image.

QoL

General user interface polish across all tabs for a smoother experience.

v1.3.8 - The "WOW" Factor
NEW

Evolution Animation System: Evolution now triggers a visual spectacle! The system was built from scratch to be modular and impactful.

NEW

Generative Sound System: Sound effects for evolution are procedurally generated by the app, eliminating the need for external audio files.

NEW

Multi-Evolution Support: Pokémon with branching evolutions (e.g., Eevee) now open a dialog for the user to choose the desired path.

QoL

Total Customization: Added options in Settings for the user to choose their preferred evolution animation style and sound effect.

v2.0.1 - The Ultimate Knowledge Hub (Current Version)
NEW

The Pokédex: A brand-new, fully interactive Pokédex tab, designed to mimic the classic feel of the device from the series. It's not just a list; it's a complete information hub.

Detailed Pokémon Info: Includes base stats, type matchups (offensive and defensive), EV yields, possible drops, and related quests.

Dynamic Stat Bars: A unique visual system that shows the strength of a Pokémon's base stats relative to all other Pokémon in the game.

Type Explorer: A complete tool to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of every type combination.

Boss Analysis & Defensive Coverage: Tools integrated into the Pokédex to check the best types against any boss or to see how your collection fares against a specific attack type.

Map Explorer: Browse all game maps and see which Pokémon spawn in each one.

Comparative Analysis: A powerful tool to compare Pokémon from your collection side-by-side, projecting their final stats at level 125 to determine the best "Tank," "Attacker," or "All-Rounder."

Game Records: A fun section to discover game records, like the Pokémon with the highest base stats, the most lucrative quests, and the rarest spawns.

EV Hotspots: Automatically calculates and ranks the best locations to train each specific EV stat, combining spawn rates and EV yields.

UPDATE

Remote Data Loading: The app now attempts to fetch the latest game data (Pokémon stats, spawn rates, etc.) directly from the project's GitHub repository upon startup, ensuring you always have the most up-to-date information without needing to download a new version of the app.

QoL

Complete Internationalization: Every single piece of text in the application is now fully translated for both Brazilian Portuguese and English, providing a native experience for all users.

FIX

Countless bug fixes and stability improvements across all features, especially in the Pokédex and Comparative Analysis tools, to ensure a smooth and crash-free experience.

Next Steps
The journey is just beginning! With the core features now stable and robust, the focus will shift to new functionalities and community requests. Keep an eye out for future updates, which may include:

Item Support: Battle simulation that takes potions and other items into account.

Move Analysis: Details on Boss attacks and suggestions for Pokémon with super-effective moves.

Damage Calculator: A tool to predict the damage of specific attacks.

And much more, based on community feedback and game updates!

❤️ A Project Made by a Fan for a Fan
The Silph Scope is a passion project, developed by a single Trainer (me, Vega!) in my spare time, with the sole goal of helping our community. The app is and always will be 100% free.

If this tool has helped you on your journey, please consider supporting me. Any donation, no matter the amount, gives me a huge incentive to continue developing, fixing bugs, and adding new features for all of us.
